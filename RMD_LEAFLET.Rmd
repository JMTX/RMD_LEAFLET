## Synopsis

This work consists in building a map with leaflet in an html document. I choose to show the adress of an asian restaurant in Paris in France on the map.

remark: the date is in french format day/month/year

```{r map_fr, warning=FALSE}
#load leaflet package
library(leaflet)

#build the map with the marker
fr_map <- leaflet() %>% 
          addTiles() %>%
          addMarkers(lat= 48.8429778, lng= 2.3633404, popup="Pause Bobun (vietnamese restaurant") # add marker at the adress of the restaurant

#show the map
fr_map  
```
